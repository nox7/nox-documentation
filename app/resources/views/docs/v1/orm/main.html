<h1>Object Relational Mapping with Abyss</h1>
<p>
	Abyss is the name given to Nox's MySQL ORM class. Unlike Laravel's Eloquent, Abyss aims to be a single-transparency window to the MySQL driver underneath. In short, using Abyss <strong>will</strong> make your life easier by allowing instantiating objects to map to MySQL tables, rows, and columns; but you won't have the feeling of a larger learning curve or that there is a lot going on under the hood.
</p>
<p>
	The use of Abyss is mainly governed by creating your own models and that ModelClass instances to interface with the database. Rarely will you need to use the <code>Abyss</code> class on its own.
</p>
<p>
	Abyss reads the database connection parameters from the <code>nox-env.php</code> file. <strong>Abyss is not necessary to use the Nox framework</strong>. You can simply comment out the <code>Abyss::loadConfig</code> line in your nox-request.php file to disable Abyss.

<h2>Loading Abyss Configuration</h2>
<p>
	By default, your nox-request.php file will come with an abyss configuration already preloaded.
</p>
<pre class="language-php line-numbers">
	<code>
		Abyss::loadConfig(__DIR__);
	</code>
</pre>
<p>
	The <code>loadConfig</code> argument should always be the app root directory (not the server root) which has the <code>nox-env.php</code> file in it. If the NoxEnv class is not loaded, Abyss will attempt to require it in the directory passed to loadConfig's first argument.
</p>
<p>
	In a standard installation, you will not need to call <code>loadConfig</code> anywhere but where it is already called for you, in nox-request.php.
</p>

<h2>Synchronizing Your Models to the Database</h2>
<p>
	In some frameworks this is called your "migrations". Nox prefers to consider naming it model synchronization because you are matching up your Nox models into your MySQL database.
</p>
<p>
	See <a href="/docs/1.x/how-to/syncing-models">Sync'ing Your Models</a> for a tutorial/explanation on how to do this.
