<h1>Synchronizing Your PHP Models to Your MySQL Database</h1>
<p>
	Now that you've built out some models for your application (if you haven't check out how to do so <a title="Nox ORM Models" href="/docs/1.x/orm/models">on the Models page</a>) - you'll need to make sure the models have MySQL tables that represent them.
</p>
<p>
	Default Nox installations, made using the installation script on the <a title="Installing Nox" href="/docs/1.x/quick-start">Installation</a> page, come with a folder titles <code>cli-scripts</code>. Inside this folder is a script you can run named `sync-models.php`.
</p>
<p>
	This script relies on you having filled out valid MySQL credentials in the <code>nox-env.php</code> file. You <strong>must</strong> have already made an existing MySQL database. Nox only will create and organize your tables (from the Models you made), but will not actually create a MySQL database for you.
</p>
<h2>Running the Synchronization Script</h2>
<p>
	Once the credentials are filled out, make sure that <code>php</code> is a valid command you can run from your command line (For Windows, your PATH variable must include a path to a folder that contains a PHP executable).
</p>
<p>
	Navigate to the <code>cli-scripts</code> folder and execute the <code>sync-models.php</code> script. A few moments will pass, and you should now see all the tables and columns properly created in your MySQL database to match all of your Models.
