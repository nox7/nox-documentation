<h1>Dynamic Routing - Routing Without Attributes</h1>
<p>
	Not all projects can be satisfied with PHP8+ attribute routing. For example, should you want to create a content management system (CMS) or similar application which allows userland routing, you will require <strong>dynamic routes</strong>.
</p>

<h2>What is a dynamic route?</h2>
<p>
	In contrast to an attribute route, a dynamic route is route that can be added after the PHP syntax has been pre-processed by the interpreter. You can create DynamicRoute objects and register them into the router.
</p>
<p>
	Why would you want to do this? Say you have a database table that has pages with a column for <code class="language-php">page_route</code>. You would want to iterate through all of your pages and register that route into the Nox router.
</p>
<h2>The DynamicRoute Object</h2>
<p>
	Dynamic routes are represented by the DynamicRoute object. Construction of one is shown below.
</p>
<pre class="language-php line-numbers">
	<code>
		new Nox\Router\DynamicRoute(
			requestMethod: &quot;get&quot;,
			requestPath: &quot;/test&quot;,
			isRegex: false,
			onRender: Closure::fromCallable(function() {
				return &quot;&lt;p&gt;Hello world&lt;/p&gt;&quot;;
			}),
		);
	</code>
</pre>
<p>
	You'll notice that there is an <code class="language-php">onRender</code> parameter in the constructor. This is a <code class="language-php">Closure</code> that holds an anonymous function to be called if the route is matched and needs to be rendered. This closure is called as a method of the <code class="language-php">BaseController</code> and as such has access to any properties or methods of that class.
</p>
<p>
	The return of the onRender closure callable should be a string or other Nox-router understand result (such as a Rewrite or Redirect) - just as it is with the attribute route methods.
</p>
<h2>Pre-flight checks on a Route Before Rendering</h2>
<p>
	Similar to how attribute routes can affect whether they will be processed when the route is matched, dynamic routes have this ability too. Optionally, you can provide the <code class="language-php">onRouteCheck</code> parameter to the DynamicRoute constructor parameters. This function is called <strong>if the route is matched</strong>. You can perform logic in this function to determine if the route can be usable. This Closure's callable <strong>must return</strong> a DynamicRouteResponse object.
</p>
<pre class="language-php line-numbers">
	<code>
		// This DynamicRoute will _never_ match
		// But it will not stop the router from checking other routes
		new Nox\Router\DynamicRoute(
			requestMethod: &quot;get&quot;,
			requestPath: &quot;/always-404&quot;,
			isRegex: false,
			onRender: Closure::fromCallable(function() {
				return &quot;&lt;p&gt;You will never see me&lt;/p&gt;&quot;;
			}),
			onRouteCheck: Closure::fromCallable(function() {
				return new Nox\Router\DynamicRouteResponse(
					isRouteUsable: false,
				);
			}),
		);
	</code>
</pre>
<p>
	A situation that this could be used in would be to check if the current HTTP session has an authenticated user. You can choose to just provide <code class="language-php">isRouteUsable</code> in the DynamicRouteResponse object constructor, or provide the other two parameters (responseCode, or newRequestPath) to <strong>stop the router from checking other routes</strong> and rewrite the request here.
</p>
<pre class="language-php line-numbers">
	<code>
		// This DynamicRoute will _never_ match
		// And it will cause the router to stop here instead
		// of continuing to search for other routes
		new Nox\Router\DynamicRoute(
			requestMethod: &quot;get&quot;,
			requestPath: &quot;/always-404&quot;,
			isRegex: false,
			onRender: Closure::fromCallable(function() {
				return &quot;&lt;p&gt;You will never see me&lt;/p&gt;&quot;;
			}),
			onRouteCheck: Closure::fromCallable(function() {
				return new Nox\Router\DynamicRouteResponse(
					isRouteUsable: false,
					responseCode:404,
				);
			}),
		);
	</code>
</pre>
<p>
	You <strong>can</strong> add DynamicRoutes with a duplicate requestPath similar to how MVC attribute routes can have multiple methods with the same request URI.
</p>
<h2>Registering a Dynamic Route into the Router</h2>
<p>
	In practice, you would add logic to your <code>nox-request.php</code> file to access the router and then add the dynamic routes with the router's method <code>addDynamicRoute</code>.
</p>
<pre class="language-php line-numbers">
	<code>
		$dynamicRoute = new Nox\Router\DynamicRoute(
			requestMethod: &quot;get&quot;,
			requestPath: &quot;/test&quot;,
			isRegex: false,
			onRender: Closure::fromCallable(function() {
				return &quot;&lt;p&gt;Hello world&lt;/p&gt;&quot;;
			}),
		);

		$router->addDynamicRoute($dynamicRoute);
	</code>
</pre>
<p>
	Now, going to <strong>/test</strong> in your Nox application will match to the above DynamicRoute and output <code>Hello world</code>.
</p>
