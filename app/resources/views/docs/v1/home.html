<h1>Getting Started with Nox - the Result-Oriented PHP MVC Web Framework</h1>
<p>
	Nox aims to introduce no new syntax other than a very basic markup for view files. Nox is a PHP-first-and-only web framework that aims to have a small footprint on your projects while introducing an easy-to-setup MVC architecture. In fact, the majority of the time there is <strong>no setup</strong> other than running the installation and setup command.
</p>
<p>
	Nox makes no attempts to be a full-service web framework, but instead serves to assist in creating your own apps and projects by being a skeleton to canvas your custom flair onto. Nox provides standard MVC attribute routing, a view rendering engine, static file serving, a lightweight MySQL ORM, and configurable project JSON files.
</p>
<p>
	This framework <strong>is not</strong> a web server and is currently only compatible with Apache web servers. The primary compatibility restriction comes from using the Apache config (.htaccess) file for route directing. Theoretically, this can be done on Nginx by forwarding requests similarly to how the default Apache config file in Nox does.

<h2>Documentation - Not an Exact Tutorial</h2>
<p>
	The Nox documentation articles are not exactly a step-by-step tutorial on building a Nox project. The <a href="/docs/1.x/quick-start" title="Installation &amp; quick start">installation page</a> is also a primer on loading the quick-start Nox project that will get everything setup for you and provide a working project to build yours off of.
</p>
<p>
	These documents are here to explain the features of Nox and how you can use them to build your application.
