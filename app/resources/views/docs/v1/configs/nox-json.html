<h1>Nox Primary JSON Configuration</h1>
<p>
	The nox.json file is the primary configuration for where the Nox framework will look for key components of your application - such as views, layouts, and controllers.
</p>
<p>
	A standard nox.json file will look as follows
</p>
<pre class="language-plain line-numbers">
	<code>
		{
		  "static-directory": "/static",
		  "layouts-directory": "/layouts",
		  "views-directory": "/views",
		  "controllers-directory": "/controllers",
		  "mysql-models-directory": "/models",

		  "404-route": "/404"
		}
	</code>
</pre>
<div class="alert alert-warning">
	All paths are relative to the Nox app directory - not the server document root.
</div>
<h2>Available Configuration Keys</h2>
<p>
	The following is an exhaustive list of configuration keys that can be placed in the nox.json file.
</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>"static-directory"</strong>: (string) The location of where to attempt to find static files to serve. </li>
	<li><strong>"static-directories"</strong>: (object) An object with keys of URI masks to map to directories to attempt to serve static files from. See <a href="/docs/1.x/static-file-serving">serving static files</a> for more on this.</li>
