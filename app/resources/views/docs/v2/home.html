<h1>Nox - the Lightweight PHP MVC Framework</h1>
<p>
	Nox is a small, lightweight PHP framework that revolves around MVC architecure. Nox takes inspiration from Java Spring Boot with file structure and organization. By utilizing the power of PHP 8 and 8.1, you'll be breaking into a new, modern era of PHP programming.
</p>
<p>
	Nox makes no attempts to be a full-service web framework, but instead serves to assist in creating your own apps and projects by being a skeleton to canvas your custom flair onto. With native PHP attribute routing, there is no need to have a route registry file - you can keep your project tight and object-oriented. Simply create a class and public methods with routes that return a stringable result.
</p>
<p>
	Nox <strong>is not</strong> a web server and is currently only compatible with Apache web servers. The primary compatibility restriction comes from using the Apache config (.htaccess) file for route directing. Theoretically, this can be done on Nginx by forwarding requests similarly to how the default Apache config file in Nox does.

<h2>This is Documentation</h2>
<p>
	The primarily aim for building Nox was to have a solid MVC framework that doesn't leave a trail on your projects. Laravel is large and is great for behemoths of projects, but when I needed something light to make small to medium projects with Nox was born. It's a simple installation with composer and then a single line to install the example project. Nothing else is needed.
</p>
<p>
	By no means does this documentation aim to instruct you on how to program individual projects. E.g., there is no full tutorial here on making a login system. Nox aims to remove as much opinion as possible and leaves implementation up to the developer. You are in control with a strong MVC foundation.
</p>
<p>
	Build reliable production-ready applications and websites with Nox.
