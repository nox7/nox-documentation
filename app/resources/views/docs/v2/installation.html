<h1>Installing Nox and Starting Your Project</h1>
<p>
	Nox is a do-less framework for Apache server PHP projects that leaves many implementations up to you. Nox aims to leave 3rd-party dependencies out of its core and up to the developer to install at-will.
</p>
<div class="alert alert-warning">
	Nox is tested primarily for Apache web servers. Nginx is not officially supported but theoretically should work out-of-the-box as long as all HTTP requests get rewritten (not redirected) to the nox-request.php file. The goal of Nox was to be a lightweight MVC framework to be deployed to the common user's web server that is managed by cPanel/WHM or self-hosted.
</div>
<h2>Installing</h2>
<content-group>
	<p>
		Nox should be installed using <a href="https://getcomposer.org/download/" target="_blank">composer</a> (For Windows, make sure to download the Windows installer and don't do it via command-line). Manual installations are at your own risk and liability. You can find the source files for <a href="https://github.com/nox7/nox" target="_blank">Nox on GitHub</a>).
	</p>
	<p>
		In the folder you want to begin your website or application, open a terminal and enter the following composer installation command.
	</p>
	<pre class="language-text line-numbers mb-3">
		<code>composer require nox7/nox</code>
	</pre>
	<p>
		Once installed, from your project root directory create a work folder for your web project to live in. Standard practice in Nox is to just name the directory for your website or application as <code>app</code>. As this directory will contain a <code>src</code> and <code>resources</code> folder later. However, you can name the top-level project (the <code>app</code> folder) whatever you'd like. For this tutorial, we will just be using "app"
	<p>
	<p>
		In a terminal where you installed Nox, run these two commands one after the other.
	</p>
	<pre class="language-text line-numbers mb-3">
		<code>
			mkdir app
			cd app
		</code>
	</pre>
	<p>
		Finally, set up the base skeleton project using the command below. You must have <code>php</code> available in your command line or PATH variable (for Windows machines).
	</p>
	<pre class="language-text line-numbers mb-3">
		<code>
			php ../vendor/nox7/nox/src/Scripts/make-sample-project.php
		</code>
	</pre>
	<p>
		Your working directory will look equivalent to the one shown below.
	</p>
	<p>
		<img alt="Nox example working directory" src="/images/v2/nox-file-system-example.png">
	</p>
	<div class="alert alert-primary">
		<strong>Note:</strong> Add the <strong>nox-env.php</strong> file to your repository's .gitignore file. This will be where your store any sensitive information like database passwords or API tokens.
	</div>
</content-group>
<h2>Your Apache Document Root</h2>
<content-group>
	<p>
		When setting up your virtual host in Apache, you should set the DocumentRoot to your <code>app</code> directory. <strong>Make every attempt to not</strong> serve your project from the project root (the parent of the <code>app</code> folder).
	</p>
</content-group>
<h2>Serving Your Nox Project from the Project Root</h2>
<content-group>
	<p>
		In the cases where you don't have a choice and the web server is serving the application or website from the project root (instead of the app directory) like in a cPanel/WHM configuration, then you can easily migrate the Apache config (<code>.htaccess</code>) file in the Nox framework to the root with a small change.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <strong>original</strong> Apache config (<code>.htaccess</code>) file is shown below.
	</p>
	<pre class="language-apache line-numbers mb-3">
		<code>
			RewriteEngine On
			RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/nox-request.php
			RewriteRule .* /nox-request.php [L,QSA]
		</code>
	</pre>
	<p>
		Move the .htaccess file to the root directory of the project (parent of the app folder) and then change the htaccess source to what is shown below.
	</p>
	<pre class="language-apache line-numbers mb-3">
		<code>
			RewriteEngine On
			RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/app/nox-request.php
			RewriteRule .* /app/nox-request.php [L,QSA]
		</code>
	</pre>
	<p>
		Your project will now serve your app without having to change your VirtualHost's DocumentRoot directive to the <code>app</code> folder.
	</p>
