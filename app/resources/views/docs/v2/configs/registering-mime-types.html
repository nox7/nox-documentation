<h1>Registering Mime Types - Setting Up File Extensions</h1>
<p>
	Nox's static filing serving system will only serve files with file extensions that are registered to a known mime type. For example, if you would not like PDF files to be served on your website then you would simply make sure there is no map for a .pdf file extension to a mime type in the mime registry.
</p>
<h2>Registering Mimes</h2>
<p>
	Typically, registration is done in the nox-request.php file; and, of course, the code registering the extension-to-mime would be before any call to read/serve files.
</p>
<pre>
	<code class="language-php line-numbers">
		// $nox is the instance of Nox from nox-request.php
		// This would allow .css files to be served and served with a text/css content-type response
		$nox-&gt;mapExtensionToMimeType("css", "text/css");

		// Also serve SCS .map files as text/plain
		$nox-&gt;mapExtensionToMimeType("map", "text/plain");
	</code>
</pre>
<p>
	You can map any file extension to any mime you require.
