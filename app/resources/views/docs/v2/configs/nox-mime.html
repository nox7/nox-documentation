<h1>Recognized MIME Types Configuration</h1>
<p>
	Because Nox handles static file serving on its own, you can control which files are even recognized or allowed to be served by adding their extensions to nox-mime.json. For example, if you do not even want to attempt to serve PDF files, remove the "pdf" entry entirely from the nox-mime.json.
</p>
<p>
	A standard nox-mime.json file will look as follows
</p>
<pre class="language-plain line-numbers">
	<code>
		{
			"css": "text/css",
			"jpg": "image/jpeg",
			"jpeg": "image/jpeg",
			"js": "text/javascript",
			"mjs": "text/javascript",
			"gif": "image/gif",
			"weba": "audio/webm",
			"webm": "video/webm",
			"webp": "image/webp",
			"pdf": "application/pdf",
			"svg": "image/svg+xml",
			"png": "image/png"
		}
	</code>
</pre>
