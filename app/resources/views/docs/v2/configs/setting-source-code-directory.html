<h1>Setting the Source Code Directory</h1>
<p>
	A project has a singular location where the source code for its operation is housed. All classes, controllers, and models belong in the descendants of this source code directory.
</p>
<h2>Auto-Loading of the Source Directory</h2>
<p>
	Nox will iterate all descendants in file-tree order of the source code directory and call <code>require_once</code> on each file in the descendants tree. Rarely should you need to <code>require</code> the files in your own source code directory unless they are in opposing file-tree order.
</p>
