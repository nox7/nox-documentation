<h1>Static File Cache Control</h1>
<p>
	In typical PHP projects, the server configuration file (htaccess or nginx config file) would control the cache age for specified MIME types.
</p>
<p>
	Because Nox has a static file serving system, you can use PHP to control the cache of static files by their MIME types.
</p>
<pre>
	<code class="language-php line-numbers">
		// Adds a 60 day cache to image/png content types
		$nox-&gt;addCacheTimeForMime("image/png", 86400 * 60);
	</code>
</pre>
<p>
	The cache age is in seconds. In this case, 86400 are the seconds in a day multiplied by 60 for 60 days of caching for PNG images.
</p>
