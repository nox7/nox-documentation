<h1>Defining a Layouts Directory</h1>
<p>
	The Nox rendering engine, when rendering a view, expects that view file to have defined a @Layout directive. This tells the rendering engine which layout file the view to be rendered will be a part of.
</p>
<p>
	The layout file defined in the view file with the @Layout directive is a relative file path from the directory you tell the Nox object to use for layouts.
