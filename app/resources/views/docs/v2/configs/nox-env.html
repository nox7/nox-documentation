<h1>The NoxEnv Pseudo Environment Class</h1>
<p>
	Nox was designed to run fluidly on Apache servers, and you cannot natively provide command-line-like environment variables to the PHP processor in Apache. NoxEnv is the structured solution to this problem.
</p>
<p>
	There are no explicit requirements by Nox for constants that must be placed in the nox-env.php file. However, the Abyss ORM does require that certain MYSQL_ constants be present should you choose to load Abyss in your application.
</p>
<div class="alert alert-danger">
	The nox-env.php is recommended to never be committed to a code repository. Instead, use the nox-env.example.php file to outline the constants your project requires and keep your API keys and other sensitives safe.
</div>
<p>
	A standard nox-env.php file will look as follows
</p>
<pre class="language-php line-numbers">
	<code>
		&lt;?php
			class NoxEnv{
				const DEV_ENV = "development";
				const MYSQL_HOST = "localhost";
				const MYSQL_PORT = "3306";
				const MYSQL_USERNAME = "root";
				const MYSQL_PASSWORD = "";
				const MYSQL_DB_NAME = "test";
			}
	</code>
</pre>
<p>
	By default, this file is required in the nox-request.php and is available in the scope of your entire project.
</p>
