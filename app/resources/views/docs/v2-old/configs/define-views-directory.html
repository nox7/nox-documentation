<h1>Defining a Views Directory</h1>
<p>
	When you serve a view file from a standard controller result, the Nox Renderer needs to know where to look for your view file relative path.
</p>
<p>
	A typical call to the <code>Renderer::renderView</code> will need a viewFileName parameter - which is a string relative path to a view file from your configured views directory.
</p>
<p>
	In the file you set up the Nox object (typically in nox-request.php) you would need to have the following definition before processing routes.
</p>
<pre>
	<code class="language-php line-numbers">
		$nox-&gt;setViewsDirectory(__DIR__ . "/resources/views");
	</code>
</pre>
<p>
	Then, when you call the renderView method of the Renderer, you would provide a relative path. Let's assume there is a folder in your views called <code>about</code> and a file called <code>main.php</code>.
</p>
<pre>
	<code class="language-php line-numbers">
		// $renderedPage is a string of the full HTML render of that main.php file
		$renderedPage = \Nox\RenderEngine\Renderer::renderView(
			viewFileName: "about/main.php",
		);
	</code>
</pre>
