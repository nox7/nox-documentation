<h1>Object Relational Mapping with Abyss</h1>
<p>
	Abyss is the name given to Nox's MySQL ORM class. Unlike Laravel's Eloquent, Abyss aims to be a single-transparency window to the MySQL driver underneath. In short, using Abyss <strong>will</strong> make your life easier by allowing instantiating objects to map to MySQL tables, rows, and columns; but you won't have the feeling of a larger learning curve or that there is a lot going on under the hood. Additionally, Abyss <strong>only supports MySQL</strong> and doesn't use PDO under the hood.
</p>
<p>
	The use of Abyss is mainly governed by creating your own models and that ModelClass instances to interface with the database. Rarely will you need to use the <code>Abyss</code> class on its own.
</p>
<p>
	In the standard example project, Abyss is loaded in nox-request.php and credentials are provided via a DatabaseCredentials object. You can register multiple database credentials to allow Abyss to interface with multiple databases. This is useful if your application or project spans multiple databases - as your models in Nox allow you to set which database that model has objects in.
</p>
<h2>Loading Abyss Configuration</h2>
<p>
	By default, your nox-request.php file will come with an abyss configuration already preloaded.
</p>
<pre class="language-php line-numbers">
	<code>
		Abyss::addCredentials(new DatabaseCredentials(
			host: NoxEnv::MYSQL_HOST,
			username: NoxEnv::MYSQL_USERNAME,
			password: NoxEnv::MYSQL_PASSWORD,
			database: NoxEnv::MYSQL_DB_NAME,
			port: NoxEnv::MYSQL_PORT,
		));
	</code>
</pre>
<h2>Synchronizing Your Models to the Database</h2>
<p>
	In some frameworks this is called your "migrations". Nox prefers to consider naming it model synchronization because you are matching up your Nox models into your MySQL database.
</p>
<p>
	See <a href="/docs/2/how-to/syncing-models">Sync'ing Your Models</a> for a tutorial/explanation on how to do this. By default, it is done by calling a CLI script - however, the code is portable into your standard application process should you wish it to be able to be called elsewhere.
