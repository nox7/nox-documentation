<h1>Model Class Instances - What are They?</h1>
<p>
	The Abyss ORM goes a step further than just creating models to represent database tables and columns. You can also have a class represent a row in a database and perform quick operations on this class. Then, you can save, create, or delete in the MySQL table that the class represents all without using MySQL syntax. Pure PHP.
</p>

<h2>How Does a Model Know Which Class Represents It?</h2>
<p>
	If you look back at the <a href="/docs/1.x/orm/models">models documentation page</a>, you will notice there is a property in the example model code that looks like this.
</p>
<pre class="language-php line-numbers">
	<code>
		private string $representingClassName = "User";
	</code>
</pre>
<p>
	In every model you create, you can define the string name of the class that will represent it. <strong>Note:</strong> The name is namespace sensitive so if you create classes inside a namespace, you must include the full namespace of that class in your model's <code>$representingClassName</code> property.
</p>
<h2>Example of a User Class to Represent the UsersModel</h2>
<p>
	In the model documentation page, the example code shows a <code>UsersModel</code> being created. Now say you want to create a class to represent a single user in the database, be able to query them, update them, create them, etc.
</p>
<p>
	Below is a barebones example that follows the properties outlined in the models documentation page.
</p>
<pre class="language-php line-numbers">
	<code>
		&lt;?php

			// Require the UsersModel
			require_once __DIR__ . "/../models/UsersModel.php";

			use Nox\ORM\Interfaces\ModelInstance;
			use Nox\ORM\Interfaces\MySQLModelInterface;
			use Nox\ORM\ModelClass;

			class User extends ModelClass implements ModelInstance
			{
				public ?int $id = null;
				public string $name;
				public string $email;
				public int $creationTimestamp;

				public static function getModel(): MySQLModelInterface{
					return new UsersModel();
				}

				public function __construct(){
					parent::__construct($this);
				}
			}
	</code>
</pre>
<p>
	The public properties of this class <strong>must</strong>, at minimum, define the columns of the model the class represents. Refer to the UserModel in the models' documentation page. The ColumnDefinition's <code>classPropertyName</code> must match a public property in the User model.
</p>
<h2>What can I do with the Users model?</h2>
<p>
	Now, when a new user is constructed the default values in the class' model are applied to the correlating public properties.
</p>
<pre class="language-php line-numbers">
	<code>
		$user = new User();
	</code>
</pre>
<p>
	For example: in the above code, because the User's model (UserModel) defines the creation_timestamp as an integer with a default value of <code>time()</code>, then accessing the property <code>->creationTimestamp</code> will provide the current UNIX time.
</p>
<pre class="language-php line-numbers">
	<code>
		$creationTime = $user->creationTimestamp;
	</code>
</pre>
<p>
	However, you will notice that the <code>id</code> property is still null.
</p>
<pre class="language-php line-numbers">
	<code>
		$userID = $user->id;
		// null
	</code>
</pre>
<p>
	This is because the user class has been instantiated, but has not been saved to the database. All model classes must extend the <code>ModelClass</code> and implement the <code>ModelInstance</code> to be considered valid in the Nox ORM. This will provide access to useful methods such as <code>save()</code>, <code>delete()</code>, and static methods <code>::saveAll()</code>, <code>::fetch()</code>, and <code>::query()</code>.
</p>
<p>
	After calling <code>save()</code> on the newly instantiated user, a database row will be created for it and the id property will be filled.
</p>
<pre class="language-php line-numbers">
	<code>
		$user->save();
		print($user->id);
		// 1
	</code>
</pre>
<p>
	Calling <code>save()</code> again will not create a new user. It will update the existing user. This is controlled by checking if class's primary key (defined by the model, UsersModel as <code>id</code>) is non-null.
</p>
<h2>Fetching a User by ID (Their Primary Key)</h2>
<p>
	Following the above code example, you can use the static methods that User has inherited to fetch a model class by its primary key.
</p>
<pre class="language-php line-numbers">
	<code>
		/** @var User $user */
		$user = User::fetch(1); // Fetches user with ID 1
	</code>
</pre>
<h2>Fetching/Querying a Collection of ModelClass Instances</h2>
<p>
	To fetch a collection of model classes (Users in this case), you will want to use the static method <code>::query()</code>. Read more in-depth on this in the <a href="/docs/1.x/orm/making-queries">making queries on model classes</a> documentation page.
</p>
<h2>Saving a Collection</h2>
<p>
	To ease the burden of network payload overhead, it is best not to loop a large collection of model classes and call <code>save()</code> on each one individually. If you have a collection of users, such as below, you can save them in one MySQL request using <code>::saveAll()</code> on your model class.
</p>
<pre class="language-php line-numbers">
	<code>
		$user1 = User::fetch(1);
		$user2 = User::fetch(2);
		$user3 = User::fetch(525);
		$user1->email = "example1@example.com";
		$user2->email = "example2@example.com";
		$user3->email = "example3@example.com";

		User::saveAll([$user1, $user2, $user3]);
	</code>
</pre>
<p>
	This will either create a database entry for each individual user, or save them via an UPDATE query.
</p>
<h2 id="queries">Deleting a ModelClass Instance from the Database</h2>
<p>
	To delete a model class instance (a row) from the database, simply call <code>delete()</code> on the instance. This will require that the instance have a primary key defined in its representing model and that the primary key be non-null.
</p>
<pre class="language-php line-numbers">
	<code>
		$user = User::fetch(105);
		$user->delete();
	</code>
</pre>
}
