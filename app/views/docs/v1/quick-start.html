<h1>Quick Start to Setting up Your Nox Project</h1>
<p>
	Nox is a do-less framework for Apache server PHP projects that leaves many implementations up to you. The only goal of Nox is to be an MVC foundation with no 3rd party dependencies outside of native PHP extensions.
</p>
<div class="alert alert-warning">
	Nox is only tested and officially supported by PHP projects on <strong>Apache servers</strong> (such as common web hosts through a cPanel interface or standalone installs). Nginx and standalone CLI has not been tested and is assumed to not work out of the box.
</div>
<h2>Installing</h2>
<content-group>
	<p>
		Nox should be installed using composer. We do not support manual installations and you can do so at your own risk.
	</p>
	<pre class="language-text line-numbers mb-3">
		<code>composer require nox7/nox</code>
	</pre>
	<p>
		Once installed, from your project root directory create a work folder for your web project to live in. Nox standard practice is to just call this folder <code>app</code>. Then change directory into that folder.
	</p>
	<pre class="language-text line-numbers mb-3">
		<code>
			mk dir app
			cd app
		</code>
	</pre>
	<p>
		Finally, setup the base skeleton project using the command below. You must have <code>php</code> available in your command line or PATH variable (for Windows machines).
	</p>
	<pre class="language-text line-numbers mb-3">
		<code>
			php ../vendor/nox7/nox/src/Scripts/make-sample-project.php
		</code>
	</pre>
	<p>
		Your working directory will look equivalent to the one shown below.
	</p>

	</p>
	<div class="alert alert-primary">
		<strong>Note:</strong> Typically, you will never want to commit your <strong>nox-env.php</strong> file and will want to add that file to your repository's .gitignore file.
	</div>

<h2>Your Apache Document Root</h2>
<content-group>
	<p>
		When setting up your virtual host in Apache, you should set your serving directory (the DocumentRoot directory in Apache configuration files) to your <code>app</code> directory. <strong>Make every attempt to not</strong> serve your project from the project root (the parent of the <code>app</code> folder).
	</p>
</content-group>
<h2>Serving Your Nox Project from the Project Root</h2>
<content-group>
	<p>
		In the cases where you don't have much control over changing your apache DocumentRoot (such as a shared host in cPanel), or where it may be too much of a hassle; you can easily migrate the Apache config (<code>.htaccess</code>) file in the Nox framework to the root with a small change.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <strong>original</strong> Apache config (<code>.htaccess</code>) file is shown below.
	</p>
	<pre class="language-apache line-numbers mb-3">
		<code>
			RewriteEngine On
			RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/nox-request.php
			RewriteRule .* /nox-request.php [L,QSA]
		</code>
	</pre>
	<p>
		To change this file to work from your project root <strong>instead of your /app directory</strong>, then move the <code>.htaccess</code> file to the project root directory (parent folder of your /app directory) and change the source to reflect this (shown below).
	</p>
	<pre class="language-apache line-numbers mb-3">
		<code>
			RewriteEngine On
			RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/app/nox-request.php
			RewriteRule .* /app/nox-request.php [L,QSA]
		</code>
	</pre>
	<p>
		Your project will now serve your app without having to change your VirtualHost's DocumentRoot directive to the <code>app</code> folder.
	</p>
