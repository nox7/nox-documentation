<title>V1.x Docs - Nox PHP Framework</title>

}
@Body{
<h1>Getting Started with Nox PHP</h1>
<p>
	Nox aims to introduce no new syntax other than a very basic markup for view files. Nox is a PHP-first-and-only web framework that aims to have a small footprint on your projects while introducing an easy-to-setup MVC architecture.
</p>
<p>
	Nox makes no attempts to be a full-service web framework, but instead serves to assist in creating your own apps and projects by being a skeleton to canvas your custom flair onto. Nox provides standard MVC attribute routing, a view file engine, static file serving, a lightweight MySQL ORM, and configurable project JSON files.
</p>
<p>
	This framework <strong>is not</strong> a web server and is currently only compatible with Apache web servers.
