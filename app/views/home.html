					<h2>Nox Philosophy</h2>

					<p>
						The Nox MVC web framework was designed against the grain of "do everything" frameworks. Typically, larger frameworks come with a lot of baggage in the forms of a long list of dependencies or many ingrained programming patterns. Additionally, they're commonly packaged with large class libraries that you must learn the API to in order to utilize their frameworks in an efficient manner.
					</p>
					<p>
						You will find that the Nox has a very minimal learning curve and its API leaves very little footprint on your projects or applications. Nox follows a standard MVC (model-view-controller) architecture for your applications. By using Nox, you will be able to have a modularized and stable web application, but with your own opinions on how to construct an application or website.

							<h2>Why PHP 8?</h2>
							<p>
								By being conservative with the minimum PHP version support, the end-resulting syntax that Nox uses is more streamlined and understandable. Nox makes use of PHP 8's attributes to handle request routing. This avoids the needs for strange PHPDoc block attribute routing or registering routes within some abstract class. See how MVC routing with PHP 8 attributes is done by viewing the <a href="/docs/1.x/routing" title="MVC routing in Nox PHP">routing docs</a>.
