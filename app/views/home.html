					<h2>Nox Philosophy</h2>
					<img src="/images/marius-niveri-rfg4l6_lu3c-unsplash.jpg" alt="Light up keyboard" class="float-end">
					<p>
						The Nox MVC web framework was designed against the grain of "do everything" frameworks. Typically, larger frameworks come with a lot of baggage. Such as:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Long dependency chains - adding to your application's tech debt and liability</li>
						<li>Custom-syntax for route parameters or ORMs</li>
						<li>Mini-frameworks inside of the encompassing framework, adding to the learning curve of that particular library</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						The Nox PHP MVC framework aims to keep invasive, opinionated patterns to a minimum. Apart from a standard MVC paradigm, the way your application's microservices and features are implemented is left up to you. Nox provides the tools you need to build a successful MVC PHP application.

							<h2>Why PHP 8?</h2>
							<p>
								By being progressive with the minimum PHP version support, the end result syntax that Nox implements is more streamlined, understandable, and compares better to larger-scale application frameworks - such as Java Spring. Nox makes use of PHP 8's attributes/decorators to handle request routing on your controller methods. This allows you to avoid having to manually add methods to a router class. Routes simply work out-of-the-box with PHP method attributes. See how MVC routing with PHP 8 attributes is done by viewing the <a href="/docs/1.x/routing" title="MVC routing in Nox PHP">routing docs</a>.
